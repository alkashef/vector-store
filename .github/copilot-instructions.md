You are GitHub Copilot, my AI coding assistant for rapid prototyping in Python.

## Stack & Environment
- Frontend: **HTML, JS, and CSS**
- Backend: **Python** with **Flask**
- ALWAYS update `requirements.txt` and `README.md` after each code edit.
- Keep all configurations in `config/.env`.
- Maintain `config/.env-example` with the same structure as `config/.env`, but use placeholders for secrets.
- Use standard libraries or popular ones (e.g., pandas, requests, langchain, openai).
- Match library usage to the versions specified in `requirements.txt`.

## Code Style & Behavior
- Follow Pythonic style, adhering to PEP 8 standards.
- Use f-Strings, Context Managers, list comprehensions, and Type Annotations.
- Add comments and docstrings for clarity.
- Place all imports at the beginning of the script.
- Keep functions short, modular, and readable.
- Avoid unnecessary boilerplate or abstractions.
- Avoid using try-except blocks unless absolutely necessary. When catching exceptions, log actionable messages and avoid swallowing errors.
- Reuse existing functions or classes when possible.
- Always encapsulate new functionality in methods.
- Avoid redundancy and keep the code concise.
- Do NOT create tests or test files unless explicitly requested by the user; do not add tests without a direct prompt.
- Do **NOT** implement fallbacks.
- Use a logger to log all details to the file specified in `LOG_FILE_PATH` from the `.env` file. Precede each log entry with a `[TIMESTAMP]` using the local computer clock.
- Do NOT hardcode prompt templates or prompt text inside source files, tests, or scripts. Place all prompt templates in the repository `prompts/` folder and load them at runtime.

## Development Approach
- Code is experimental and iterative; designs change frequently.
- Common components: data pipelines, API calling LLM/GPT, lightweight UI.
- Prioritize fast feedback, working code, and flexibility over strict architecture.
- Take your time to reason through the code before suggesting.
- Prioritize quality, clarity, and correctness over speed.
- Prefer complete and coherent code blocks over partial or rushed suggestions.

## Documentation & Guidance
- Always check the official documentation for the exact version of the library listed in `requirements.txt`.
- Avoid using features or syntax from newer versions.
- Update the README.md if new features or significant changes are introduced.
- Never hardcode or echo secret keys; rely on `config/.env`.
- When adding debug output, keep it optional, lightweight, and safe; prefer using the existing logger.
- Proceed with deletes and renames as instructed, without confirmation.
- Keep the existing README structure; only add/change details within current sections. Ask before removing or adding sections.
- Use the README to document outputs and usage only; do not use it to change project inputs or behavior.
- **After each code edit or ask, update:
  - `requirements.txt` if new libraries are used, versions changed, or libraries removed. 
  - `README.md` if new features or significant changes are introduced. Include how to setup and test. 

## Communication
- Avoid repetition of instructions or disclaimers.
- Be **very concise and to the point.**
- Less verbose is better.
- Don't explain your internal thought process and todo steps unless asked.
- When you are prompoted to fix an issue:
    - Think deeply. Leave no stone un-turned.
    - Explain the root cause in one line.
    - Explain the fix in one line.
    - Don't apply the fix.
    
## Project Files
Maintain the following project structure:

**Front-end**
- app.py: Streamlit application entry point.

**Backend**
- utils/: Utility functions and helper modules.
- store/: Data storage and retrieval modules.
- store/weaviate_data/: Modules related to Weaviate data storage.

**Configuration & Logs**
- config/: Configuration files, including .env for environment variables.
- config/.env: Environment variables and configuration settings.
- config/settings.py: Configuration settings for the application.
- logs/: Directory for log files.
